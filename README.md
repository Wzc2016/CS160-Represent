# Represent!

Simple example of using the Google GEO API and CIVIC API to lookup Senate and House Representatives. You will need to use these API calls within Android Studio for PROG02 assignment.  This serves as an example of how the calls function and how to parse the JSON results. This should help get you started. Please note that this code does not handle all errors properly.  

## Getting Started

Python example of using Google Civic API and GEo API. You will need to have your own KEY to properly use the API. Instructions on Piazza for how to set that up.

* Setup your Google Cloud APIs
* Make a new Project for all CS160 Stuff
* You need to [enable Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/billing/enable) to use the free CS160 credits 

### Prerequisites

* pip install requests â€“ for making HTTP requests in Python
* [Google CIVIC API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information) - Used to lookup representatives
* [Google GEO API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview) - Used for GEO and reverese GEO lookups
